# Summary

A study by [De Angelis et al.][https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61192-y#data-availability] found associations between the human gut microbiome and diet. In it they took shotgun metagenomic samples of the human gut microbiome from 30 volunteers on either a omnivourus, vegan, or vegetarian diet and correlated diet with gut microbial profile. 

The human gut microbiome shotgun metagenomic data with sequences filtered for human reads and trimmed of low-quality bases are publically available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI SRA; SRP083099, Bioproject ID PRJNA340216).

In my project I intend to 

1. Download human gut microbiome shotgun metagenomic dataset files from NCBI SRA; SRP083099, Bioproject ID PRJNA340216
2. Check quality 
3. Run Kraken2 for assigning taxonomy
